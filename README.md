A small app to help you track your spending

## Motivation

I am an impulsive spender. Seeing that my monthly income always turns almost 0 by the 20th, I thought to myself.

**NO**

So I made this app to help me track my spending.

## Usage
This app, by no mean, manage your spending. It doesn't have any way to enforce your spending habit
and I am not planning to add any. It's only a log book for your spending, so you have a way of knowing
how much you've spent.

### Home screen:
- Show your spendings, organized by month.
- Have a speed dial to quickly log your income, expense, loan or saving

### Income:
Log your income here.

### Saving:
By saving a certain amount of cash, you essentially take that amount out of your current budget and
put it in the saving. You can then take the saving out if you needed it

### Expense:
Log your expenses here. Remember, only necessary expense can be logged directly. For other type of expenses,
create a wishlist item first.

### Wishlist
If you want to spend your money on something not necessary, you should spend sometime thinking about it first.
Create a wish item first, consider about it for a while and then make the purchase when you are really sure.

## Install

I don't really want to put this app on App store and Play store, so just sideload it if you want to install it.
I don't know, might change my mind.

## Contribution

Yeah this source code is free. Do what ever you want with it.
